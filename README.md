## 💡 How it Works
ShortLinkX works by taking a long URL input from the user and generating a unique shortened URL. It does this by utilizing PHP to handle form submissions and generate short URLs. The short URL is then displayed to the user, ready to be copied and shared. When someone accesses the shortened URL, the PHP code in ShortLinkX identifies the corresponding long URL and redirects the user to it.
